Explanation of Part 1 tests

p1-1.asm:
	This test targets EX-EX forwarding.
	The forwarding is to be used between instruction 3 (subi) and instruction 4 (add).
	There is a RAW dependency, because we are writing to r2 and then immediately reading from r2.
p1-2.asm:
	This test targets MEM-EX forwarding.
	The forwarding is to be used between instruction 5 (ld) and instruction 6 (add).
	There is a RAW dependency, because we are loading into r1, and then immediately rasing the contents of r1.
p1-3.asm:
	This test targets MEM-MEM forwarding.
	The forwarding occurs between instruction 5 (ld) and instruction 6 (st).
	It is necessary to use Mem-Mem forwarding, because we are loading into one register r1, and then using its value to store to memory.
